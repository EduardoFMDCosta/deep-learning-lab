# deep-learning-lab

**deep-learning-lab** repository contains the code for small-scale experiments with Deep Learning techniques. Most of the activities were originally proposed by Professor Stephane Gaiffas (University of Paris, LPSM) during the Deep Learning course of the MSc in Applied Mathematics at University of Paris in 2021. For detailed information on the course, please refer to the comprehensive [course page](https://stephanegaiffas.github.io/deep_learning/).

Notebooks marked with (*) are based on the code structure provided by Prof. Gaiffas. You can find the original notebooks on the aforementioned web page.

The repository includes the following notebooks:

- **A fashionable use case: clothing classification with fashion-mnist** (*) (Dec 2021): this introductory notebook presents the implementation of multiple neural networks (using TensorFlow) with the goal to accurately predict clothing types based on images from the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist).
- **How does the optimizer choice affect features transferability?** (Feb 2022): in this project, we re-run the main analysis made in Kornblith, Simon, et al (2021) - see References in the notebook - building convolutional models in which the only change is the choice of the optimizer (instead of the loss function). This was presented as the final project of the Deep Learning course at University of Paris.
